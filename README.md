# Getting started with XMM Gaussian Mixture Regression in JUCE

#### simple JUCE example of an XMM-based OSC app

This example implements a wekinator-style application without any GUI.  
It wraps several classes of the [XMM library](http://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm) together
and provides a simple and intuitive higher-level interface.  
It contains an example Max patch for testing the regression with a simple synthesizer.
